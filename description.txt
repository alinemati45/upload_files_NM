Data Integrity
- Columns Info: Each column's role and logical type should be returned.
- Conflicting Labels: The check looks for samples that are identical but have different labels. 
This can happen due to Â mislabeled data or because the data collected appears to lack the features required to separate the labels. 
If the data is incorrectly labelled, it can confuse the model and cause it to perform poorly.
goal is "Identify samples with identical feature values but distinct label labels."
- Data Duplicates: 
- Feature Feature Correlation
- Feature Label Correlation
- Identifier Label Correlation
- Is Single Value
- Mixed Data Types
- Mixed Nulls
- Outlier Sample Detection
- Special Characters
- String Length Out Of Bounds
- String Mismatch
