Depending on the phase of NM project and desired validation techniques are required to apply, you will need a subset of the subsequent:

- Raw data (string processing, etc.) with labels.

- Labeled training data for the model

- Test data (to which the model has not been exposed)

A supported model that you would like to validate, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, or PyTorch.
